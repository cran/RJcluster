Description: Clustering algorithm for high dimensional data. Assuming that P feature measurements on N objects are arranged in an NÃ—P matrix X, this package provides clustering based on the left Gram matrix XX^T. To simulate test data, type "help('simulate_HD_data')" and to learn how to use the clustering algorithm, type "help('RJclust')". To cite this package, type 'citation("RJcluster")'.
