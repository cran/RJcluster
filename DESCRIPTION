Description: Clustering algorithm for high dimensional data. This algorithm is ideal for data where N << P. Assuming that P feature measurements on N objects are arranged in an NÃ—P matrix X, this package provides clustering based on the left Gram matrix XX^T. When the P-dimensional feature vectors of objects are drawn independently from a K distinct mixture distribution,  the N-dimensional  rows of the modified Gram matrix XX^T/P converges almost surely to K distinct cluster means. This transformation/projection thus allows  the  clusters  to  be  tighter  with  order of P.  To simulate data, type "help('simulate_HD_data')" and to learn how to use the clustering algorithm, type "help('RJclust')".
